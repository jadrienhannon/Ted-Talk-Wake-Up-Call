# Ted Talk Wake Up Call
A basic web scraping program to select a random Ted Talk from a certain search query. Designed for Windows 10, to be used in coordination with Windows task scheduler in order to be ran automatically every morning.
## You must have the task scheduler running the .bat file, and you must have chromedriver.exe installed in your chrome application folder, with that folder added to the system enviromental variables.
